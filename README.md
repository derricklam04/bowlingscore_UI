# Bowling Score Board

### Score System:
- 1 point is rewarded for each pin knocked down.
- In a strike, a score of 10 (for knocking down all 10 pins) is rewarded plus a bonus score of your next two rolls.
- In a spare, a score of 10 (for knocking down all 10 pins) is rewared plus a bonus score of your next roll. 

In the case that a strike or spare is rolled, your score will not be displayed until there is sufficient information (the following rolls) or until you have reached the end of the game. 

In the 10th frame, if you knocked down all 10 pins within the first 2 attempts, you are rewarded with a third and final attempt. 

### How to use: 
Enter the amount of pins you've knocked down sequentially. 

- Enter a number (1-9) for the amount of pins knocked down.
- Enter 'x' for a strike. ( Can only be entered on your first attempt in a frame )
- Enter '/' for a spare. ( Can only be entered on your second attempt in a frame )
- Enter '-' for a gutter bowl, 0 pins knocked.
